# Universe
- Galaxies
- Planetary systems
- Planets

Everything in the universe is static – nothing moves  – from the point of view of the system. Of course you can visualize the universe in game clients as a dynamical system but it will be just pretty illusion.

## Galaxies
New galaxies are generated during planets generations.

If new galaxy is generated depends on:

- If each of current galaxies contains at least minimal amount of planetary systems.
- If algorithm whose input is a random decides that new galaxy should be generated.

Distances between galaxies are approximately 50 times bigger than distances between planetary systems.
